# Key Features

## Roguelike Randomization
- **Randomized Gyms:** Gyms are randomized; upon entering a gym, you'll be warped to any gym at random. Leader teams are adjusted to your current strength.
- **Elite... Eight!?:** Battle Frontier Brains join the Elite Four for more diverse lineup of final bosses.

## Difficulty Boosts
- **Buffed Battles:** All enemy trainers use perfect 31-IV Pokémon. All gym leaders and Elite Four members' Pokémon have optimal natures. 
- **Nuzlocke Mechanics:** Your Pokémon can’t overlevel the most powerful Pokémon of the next major boss trainer. You can’t use items in battle.
- **Updated Teams:** Gym leaders use more well-rounded teams, having bolstered their rosters with new Alolan, Hisuian, and Galarian members.
- **New Final Fights:** The champion and final battle is now Steven Stone wielding a Mega Metagross. Wallace, meanwhile, now joins Juan to make the 8th gym a double battle.

## Quality of Life Improvements
- **Level Cap Candy:** Instantly jumps your Pokémon to the level it next learns a move, evolves, or hits the current cap (whichever of the three comes first). The evolution animation is shortened. Asking to learn a move only asks once, not twice.
- **Fully Stocked PC:** Your PC now comes stocked with every Pokémon and item in the auction pool. Simply withdraw what you need from your PC and start racing.
- **Permanent Repel:** The Cleanse Tag now functions as a permanent repel.
- **Universal Fly:** All Pokémon can Fly in the overworld without knowing the move and without the Fortree Gym Badge.
- **Visible IVs:** When paused to view your Pokémon’s stats, press A to display their IVs.

## Modern Mechanics
- **Fairy Types:** Fairy Type has been added to the game. Pokémon have had their typing and learnsets updated to generation VII.
- **Generation VIII Pokémon and Items:** The auction pool includes Pokémon and items all the way up to additions from Pokémon Legends: Arceus.
- **Mega Evolution:** Mega Stones are here! Click `Fight` in battle and then press Start before selecting your move to mega evolve. Mega stones are one-time-use and consumed once used.
- **Modern TM Mechanics:** TMs are reusable. HMs are forgettable.
- **Physical/Special Split:** Moves now calculate damage based on the split introduced in generation IV. Thunder Punch, for example, calculates its damage based on your Pokémon’s attack stat. In Emerald, it originally would have used the Special Attack stat, since Thunder Punch is an electric-type move.

## Shop Inventories
- **Evolution Items:** Evolution items like the Dawn Stone and Razor Fang are available at the Lavaridge Herb Shop and Lilycove Department store.
- **Mega Stones:** Mega Stones are now available at the Slateport outdoor market and Ever Grande City.
